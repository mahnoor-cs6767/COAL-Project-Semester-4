## 🧠 Project Description  
This project was developed as part of the **COAL** course in the fourth semester. It focuses on building a basic **calculator** using **Assembly Language**, demonstrating low-level programming concepts and processor-level operations.

The calculator performs:

- ➕ Addition  
- ➖ Subtraction  
- ✖️ Multiplication  
- ➗ Division  

It uses **MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler)** to execute instructions and interact with the user via console.

## 💡 Features  

- 🔢 Perform basic arithmetic operations  
- 🖥️ Console-based interface  
- 🧠 Demonstrates register usage and instruction flow  
- 📥 Accepts user input  
- 📤 Displays result using Assembly output logic  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  

- **Language:** Assembly Language (x86)  
- **Assembler:** MASM  
- **Concepts:** Registers, Instructions, Loops, Conditional Logic
